        <p class="about_font">
          The Institute commenced its academic session from August 2015. The           Institute is currently operating out of its transit campus housed in           the IT Park in Hubballi with well-equipped classrooms, laboratories           and a library.IIIT Dharwad is keen to develop its permanent campus in           a plot of 61 acres allotted by the Government of Karnataka at           Tadasinakoppa village between Hubballi and Dharwad cities. As a           not-for-profit institute of higher learning in the area of Information           Technology (IT), the primary objective of IIIT Dharwad is to address           the skill gap in high-end information technology and thereby enable           India to retain its global leadership role in IT and allied areas. To           achieve this objective, IIIT Dharwad currently offers B.Tech. Degree           programmes in Computer Science and Electronics & Communication.

          “As the Chairperson of the Board of Governors of IIIT Dharwad, I would           like to share a slice of wisdom with the young generation around us:           Vision without action is merely a dream; action without vision is           merely passing time; but vision and action together can change the           world. We can give our children only two things in life which are           essential – strong roots and powerful wings. Afterwards, they may fly           anywhere and live independently; of all the luxuries in life, the           greatest one is getting freedom of the right kind. To come up in life,           the young generation requires talent, hard work, drive, and ability to           communicate genuinely with people. With my experience in life, I feel           that having good relationships, compassion, and peace of mind is much           more important than achievements, awards, degrees, or money. Hence, we           should always have a definite aim in life which we must try to achieve           while being of help to others. I wish IIIT Dharwad great success in           shaping young minds into professionals with the best of skills coupled           with the highest of values.”
